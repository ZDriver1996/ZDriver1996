- 👋 Hi, I’m @ZDriver1996
- 👀 I'm currently a firefighter paramedic. I am the driver and engineer on a ladder truck. I've worked 4 years as an accountant primarily in payroll tax accounting. When I'm not fumbling around learning code, i'm in the gym, mountain biking, playing guitar, playing underneath the hood of a car or out exploring different countries. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JS. I've been using W3Schools, Youtube, and Udacity as education sources. I've been using VS code to practice creating local webpages. I would like to learn front end development with a focus on creating more secure webpages/programs. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple projects that will help accelerate needed real world programming skill sets. 
- 📫 How to reach me: leonhartsock@hotmail.com  leonhartsock@tutanota.com  and you can call 911 (just kidding don't do that)
